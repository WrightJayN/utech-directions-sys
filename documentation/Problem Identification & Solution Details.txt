Problem
  Students, especially incoming students, struggle to locate their classrooms. A survey indicated that students would benefit from a system providing directions to their classes.

Solution Requirements
  Allow students to enter a classroom number
  Provide directions to that classroom

Possible Solutions
  - Interactive map of U-Tech allowing students to navigate and explore buildings
  - Web app providing video directions and pictures to buildings, floors, and rooms
  - Web app providing text directions and pictures to buildings, floors, and rooms

Chosen solution
  The interactive map approach was rejected because it would require students to search the entire map instead of simply entering a classroom number.
  
  Solution
    A web app that provides directions to the corresponding building and floor of the room the user wants to go to.
    
    Inputs
    1. From room (default::main gate)
    2. To room
  
    Outputs
      Building picture
      Floor picture
      Floor Highlight
      Map with Path

Limitations
  Why no specific directions to room?
    Due to project complexity, directions are only provided to buildings and floors, not individual rooms.
  
  Why no video?
    Due to storage, scalability, and complexity concerns, videos are replaced with building and floor pictures. Building-to-building directions are provided by the Map with Path output.

Algorithms
  Dijkstra's Algorithm
    For finding the shortest path with weighted edges (pixel distance)
    Uses min heap to explore nodes with minimum distance first
  Drawing Path
    Get vertices of the from and to buildings
    Draw yellow lines along path
    Color in from building in red
    Color in to building in blue

Data Structures
  - Rooms Hash Map for searching for rooms 
  - Tree for finding the corresponding building and floors
  - Building Vertices Hash Map for coloring building
    Key::node
    Value::Set of x,y coordinates (vertices of the building)
  - Graph for finding path from building to building
  - Tree To Graph Hash Map used to find corresponding graph nodes for tree

Data Flow Components
  Inputs
    User provides "from" room and "to" room.

  Data Collector
    Converts room inputs into lowercase strings.

  Room node Finder
    Uses Rooms Hash Map to find corresponding rm_t_nodes (room tree nodes) from the input strings.

  Building/Floor Node Finder
    Uses tree structure to find corresponding bld_t_nodes (building tree nodes) and flr_t_nodes (floor tree nodes) from the rm_t_nodes.
    If rm_t_nodes is a gate then bld_t_nodes will be rm_t_nodes and flr_t_nodes will be a virtual node with the name 'floorGateGround'.
  
  Outputs
    Building pictures
      Takes to_bld_t_node and outputs the destination building picture.

    Floor pictures
      Takes to_flr_t_node and outputs the destination floor picture.

    Floor Highlight
      Takes to_flr_t_node and outputs a canvas showing all floors with the destination floor highlighted.

    Map with Path
      PathFinder
        Takes to_bld_t_node and from_bld_t_node, finds corresponding g_nodes, and calculates the path from from_bld_g_node to to_bld_g_node.
      PathDrawer
        Loads UTech map image and creates canvas.
        Draws yellow lines along Path.
        Gets vertices of from and to buildings from Building Vertices Hash Map.
        Colors from building red and to building blue using their vertices.
        Sends map with drawn path to user.
