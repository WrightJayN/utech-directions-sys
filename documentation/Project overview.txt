Problem: Lack of readily available directions for finding rooms/floors/buildings at UTech, Ja Papine Campus
Solution: A lightweight web app used for requesting directions from one location on campus to another.
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, and JS
Algorithms:
  Dijkstra's Algorithm (Path Finding): For finding the shortest path with weighted edges (pixel distance) 
  Path Drawing Algorithm: For coloring in source and destination buildings and pathway
  Fuzzy Search: For autocomplete with high tolerance of user mistakes.
Data Structures:
  HashMap: For quick lookup of room/floor/building
  Tree: For organizing and maintaining relationship between rooms, floors and buildings
  Building Vertices HashMap: For keeping track of building vertices needed for coloring
  Graph: For storing nodes and edges needed for path finding
Main Data Flow:
  Input: Two inputs for source and destination (where the user is coming from and where they want to go)
  Validation: Ensures both inputs are not empty and exist in the tree (this is done by checking the HashMap)
  Find Required Nodes: Gets the corresponding node from the HashMap for both inputs
  Building Picture: Outputs the building picture of the destination input
  Floor Picture: Outputs the floor picture of the destination input if destination input is not a building
  Map with Route: Outputs a map of utech with the source and destination buildings and path between them colored
Limitations:
  No video is shown but rather pictures
  Map is not interactive
