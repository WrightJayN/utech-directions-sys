Problem
  Students, especially incoming students, struggle to locate their classrooms. A survey indicated that students would benefit from a system providing directions to their classes.

Solution Requirements
  Allow students to enter a classroom number
  Provide directions to that classroom

Possible Solutions
  - Interactive map of U-Tech allowing students to navigate and explore buildings
  - Web app providing video directions and pictures to buildings, floors, and rooms
  - Web app providing text directions and pictures to buildings, floors, and rooms

Chosen solution
  The interactive map approach was rejected because it would require students to search the entire map instead of simply entering a classroom number.
  
  Solution
    A web app that provides directions to the corresponding building and floor of the room the user wants to go to.
    
    Inputs
    1. From room (default::main gate)
    2. To room
  
    Outputs
      Building picture
      Floor picture
      Floor Highlight
      Map with Path

Limitations
  Why no specific directions to room?
    Due to project complexity, directions are only provided to buildings and floors, not individual rooms.
  
  Why no video?
    Due to storage, scalability, and complexity concerns, videos are replaced with building and floor pictures. Building-to-building directions are provided by the Map with Path output.


Algorithms
  Breadth-first search
    For finding the shortest path

Data Structures
  Hash Map for searching for rooms 
  Tree for finding the corresponding building and floors
  Graph/Adj list for finding path from building to building

Data Flow Components
  Inputs
    User provides "from" room and "to" room.

  Data Collector
    Converts room inputs into strings.

  Room node Finder
    Uses hashmap to find corresponding rm_t_nodes (room tree nodes) from the input strings.

  Building/Floor Node Finder
    Uses tree structure to find corresponding bld_t_nodes (building tree nodes) and flr_t_nodes (floor tree nodes) from the rm_t_nodes.
  
  Outputs
    Building pictures
      Takes to_bld_t_node and outputs the destination building picture.

    Floor pictures
      Takes to_flr_t_node and outputs the destination floor picture.

    Floor Highlight
      Takes to_flr_t_node and outputs a canvas showing all floors with the destination floor highlighted.

    Map with Path
      PathFinder
        Takes to_bld_t_node and from_bld_t_node, finds corresponding g_nodes, and calculates the path from from_bld_g_node to to_bld_g_node.
      PathDrawer
        Takes the calculated path, loads the UTech map image, creates a canvas, draws the path onto the map, and sends it to the user.
